# Implement-the-Word2Vec-mode
## Description-
The code trains a Word2Vec model using Gensim on a set of sentences. It tokenizes the sentences, sets up the Word2Vec model with specific parameters, saves the model to a file, and then loads it back. Finally, it retrieves the word embedding for the word "engineering" from the loaded model. Word embeddings are numerical representations capturing semantic information about words based on their context in the training data.
## Explanation-
  -Imports: The code imports necessary modules, including Word2Vec from gensim.models, word_tokenize from nltk.tokenize, and the nltk library itself.

  -Download NLTK Data: The code downloads the NLTK data required for tokenization using nltk.download('punkt').

  -Sentences: The code defines a list of sentences that serve as the corpus for training the Word2Vec model.

  -Tokenization: It tokenizes each sentence into words using word_tokenize, converting all words to lowercase.

  -Word2Vec Model: The code initializes a Word2Vec model with the tokenized sentences. Parameters like vector_size (dimensionality of the word vectors), window (maximum distance between the current and predicted word within a sentence), and min_count (minimum frequency count of words) are set.

  -Saving the Model: The trained Word2Vec model is saved to a file named "word2vec_model_sentences.bin".

  -Loading the Model: The saved model is loaded back into memory from the file.

  -Word Embedding: The code retrieves the word embedding for the word "engineering" from the loaded model and prints it.
